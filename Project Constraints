# Project Constraints 

1.	Time: This is a key constraint to our senior design project. With the two semesters going by much faster than anticipated as well as other classwork and work in general it becomes an issue managing our time correctly. Especially since we’re doing it as a team, meaning if one thing isn’t done by one group member it may delay another member from starting on their task(s). We have created a Gantt chart that we hope to follow throughout the yearlong course to assure that we don’t get behind and finish our project by the time we anticipated it to be completed.  

2.	Look and Feel: NOT DONE

3.	Scope: NOT DONE Does your team agree on the scope of the project? Does each team member understand the scope of their contribution to successful project?

4.	Professional/Technical: NOT DONE Does your project need or require apply specialized technical expertise? How does lack of such expertise impact your solutions?
