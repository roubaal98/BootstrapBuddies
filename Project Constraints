# Project Constraints 

1. Time: This is a key constraint to our senior design project. With the two semesters going by much faster than anticipated as well as other classwork and work in general it becomes an issue managing our time correctly. Especially since we’re doing it as a team, meaning if one thing isn’t done by one group member it may delay another member from starting on their task(s). We have created a Gantt chart that we hope to follow throughout the yearlong course to assure that we don’t get behind and finish our project by the time we anticipated it to be completed.  
2. Look and Feel:
3. Scope: Our team does agree with the scope that we have laid out for our project. As well as each member understanding the scope of their own contribution. We have made a Gantt chart showing our timeline with each task that needs to be completed by each group member. If we each follow the timeline that we created, we should be able to complete the project in the time that we hoped to finish it
