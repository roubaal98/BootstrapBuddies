# Abstract
## The purpose of DATS CHESS is to build a functional chess engine capable of playing full length games against a user and to build an associated web application to facilitate said games.  The initial focus is to create an engine and application that is just functional.  However, when this goal is achieved, we will continue to progress our project incrementally.
