## Projects Sought
- I'm looking to do something that involves streaming video or any sort of front end / back end application. I am open to get out of my comfort zone and try new things. I have always wanted to build a website that is similar to wix, but actually translates into different platforms like Java / Kotlin for android, or brightscipt for Roku. I also like the idea of a security camera that detects movement and makes clips out of this, and properly distributes the video to clients. I think this might be a great introduction to transcoding and backend for streaming video. Lastly, I would also like to do a chess engine.
