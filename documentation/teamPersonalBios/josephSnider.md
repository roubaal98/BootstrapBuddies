# Co-op Work Experience
* FOX Sports Software Developer; Employed January of 2019
* While working here, I got practice and experience in C#, SQL, CSHTML, MudBlazor, and CSS.
* Non-technical skills include presenting in a meeting, sharing ideas, and becoming a professional.
* This has been my only Co-op but I have dabbled in some coding outside of work for fun.
# Project Sought
  * Something that I can apply the knowledge I have gained from work and school.
    An app would be cool as well as a new innovative website. Ideally I want to create a fantasy sports app/website but would have to fork over some money for the data unless I were to web scrape. :fearful:
